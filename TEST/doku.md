Provide each server’s IP address.Ensure that each entry corresponds to a properly configured and reachable server that meets your application’s requirements. |
| useVMSelection | Do you want choose Servers from List? | boolean | Optional | n/a | n/a | Select this checkbox if you prefer to choose servers from an existing list rather than manually entering server details. When enabled, a predefined list of validated servers will be available for selection, helping to streamline the configuration process and reduce manual errors. |
| selectedVMs | List of Virtual Machine | string[] | Optional | n/a | Action: net.atos.dhc.firewall.manage/returnVirtualMachineListwithIP | Use this dual-list control to manage your virtual machine selection. The left side displays all available virtual machines, while the right side shows the ones chosen for the deployment. Move items between lists using the provided controls to add or remove virtual machines as needed. Ensure that the selected VMs are properly configured for your environment. |
| lb_algorithm | Load Balancer Algorithm | string | Required if useExistingPool equals | n/a | LB_ALGORITHM_ROUND_ROBIN, LB_ALGORITHM_LEAST_CONNECTIONS, LB_ALGORITHM_SOURCE_IP, LB_ALGORITHM_CONSISTENT_HASH, LB_ALGORITHM_RANDOM | Select the appropriate algorithm for distributing traffic among backend servers. This dropdown lists available algorithms—such as Round Robin, Least Connections —that determine how requests are allocated. Choose the algorithm that best aligns with your application’s performance, reliability, and scaling requirements. |
| useExistingHealthMonitor | Do you want use existing Health Monitor ? | boolean | Optional | n/a | n/a | Select this checkbox if you wish to use a pre-configured health monitor to assess the status and performance of your backend servers. When enabled, the deployment will reference an existing health monitor configuration, saving you time and ensuring consistency. If you leave it unchecked, a new health monitor will be created based on your specified settings. |
| existingHealthMonitor | Existing Health Monitor | string | Required if useExistingHealthMonitor equals | n/a | Action: net.atos.dhc.automation/getAVIHealthMonitor | Select an existing health monitor from the dropdown list. These monitors are pre-configured to regularly check the availability and performance of your backend servers. Each monitor is set up with specific parameters—such as health check intervals, timeout values, and criteria for determining server status |
| health_monitor_type | Health Monitor Type | string | Required if useExistingHealthMonitor equals | n/a | HEALTH_MONITOR_HTTP, HEALTH_MONITOR_HTTPS, HEALTH_MONITOR_TCP, HEALTH_MONITOR_ICMP, HEALTH_MONITOR_EXTERNAL | Select the appropriate type of health monitor for your deployment.
